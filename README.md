<h2>Pacman Exercise</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This is the Pacman Exercise for Week 7 of MIT xPRO coding bootcamp.

<h3>Description</h3>
Animation of the classic video game character bouncing his way across the screen. 

<h3>How to Run</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Use 'Add PacMan' button to generate new PacMen on screen.</li>
  <li>Click 'Start Game' to get them all moving.</li>
  <li>Use 'Pause' and 'Unpause' to start and stop PacMen movement.</li>
  <li>'Gotta Go Fast!' will accelerate PacMen on each click. Reset with 'Pause'.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
I plan to create a dedicated game board rather than using the size of the window, add keyboard direction control,
and objects with collision detection more in line with the classic game. I will also add restrictions to keep PacMen from accelerating exponentially, and a single button to clear the page and start over.
